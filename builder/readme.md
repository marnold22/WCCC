# **Wordpress Builder**
**To Build the Site**
1. Make sure you have `node` installed on your computer (if not run `brew install node` if you have `homebrew`)
2. Navigate to the `builder` folder in your terminal
3. Run `npm install` --> this will install the necessary node dependencies
4. To compile everything (without automatic updates) run `gulp build` which will default to `php`, but adding the `--html` flag after `gulp build` will compile everything to html
5. To compile everything (with automatic updates) run `gulp`
